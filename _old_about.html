      <h1>About company</h1>
      <p>since 2019</p>
      <p>A company specializing in game development for mobile platforms and PC.
        Theoretical Studio is a small, independent game studio focused on developing games with unusual game mechanics. We develop games in different genres and for different platforms that we ourselves are interested in playing.
        <p>The studio was born as a continuation of a long history of participation in various game-jams (Ludum Dare, GMTK), in the framework of which more than 30 games were created, and the experience of the participants allowed us to take game development seriously.
        <p>The reason we came together initially is a love for games and game development.
        The company's mission is to provide a space and resources for the creativity of its members.  And also to create an organization where creativity is comfortably realized and interesting and engaging worlds and stories are created for the greatest number of players. We pay a lot of attention to the games themselves, but at the current stage we actively seek to ensure the viability of such an idea from a business perspective.
        <p>We deeply value the gaming experience and therefore develop mobile and PC games where the gaming experience is at the forefront.
        <p>The studio is now in its infancy as a commercial organization, has experience developing applications for mobile devices and is ready to scale ready-made games that have already hit the market.</p>
