      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective date: 25.10.2021

        Theoretical Studio (“us”, “we”, or “our”) represented by sole proprietor Shishov Gleb Aleksandrovich operates
        the Save The Fluffy Premium mobile game application (the “Game”).

        This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you
        use our Game and the choices you have associated with that data.
        We use your data to provide and improve the Game. By using the Game, you agree to the collection and use of
        information in accordance with this policy.
        What type of data is collected and from what sources?
        We use third-party services described below to collect your data while you are using the Game. The information
        we collect is non-identifiable to you. For example, we will collect device information, like IP address and
        device identifiers, as well as events completed or actions taken within the Game (the “Data”):
        User interface interaction events (number and order of button presses)
        Level completion statistics
        Time spent in-game

        We use Unity Analytics, an analytics service offered by Unity Technologies, 30 3rd Street, San Francisco, CA
        94103, and Unity Technologies Finland OY, Kaivokatu 8 B, 00100 Helsinki, Finland. Unity Analytics collects
        Personal Information directly from your device and uses this Personal Information to help us analyze your use of
        the Game. You can view their Privacy Policy, which includes instructions on how to restrict the collection of
        Personal Information.
        When you purchase in-Game content or features using the Google Play Store, we may receive your email address,
        zip code, city, state or country, and purchase history. You can view their Privacy Policy, which includes
        instructions on how to restrict the collection of Personal Information.
        Who do we share this data with?
        We share this data in an anonymous form with Unity Technologies (“Unity”), our service provider for analytics.
        As such, by using the Game you are also agreeing to Unity’s privacy policy, which can be found here:
        https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy.
        When we use third-parties like Unity, we enter into contracts with them where they are obliged to maintain the
        confidentiality of the information we share with them and use it only for the purpose related to the supply of
        their services to us.
        Why do we collect the Data?
        We use the Data to make more informed decisions about the Game and improve your play experience. The Data can
        help troubleshoot and address any bugs, technical issues or errors. Unity will send us reports on this Data
        which gives us insight on the Game, how players use it, how the Game can be improved and how we can support
        updates.
        Changes to This Privacy Policy
        I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for
        any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
